\f0\fs24 \cf0 For the past several years, I have been working on a world known as \'93Starrise\'94. Though originally it was a collaborative work made by myself and my best friend, my co-writer has since grown tired of it and given me complete creative control of the project. The single biggest driving force of this fantasy world is the scientific organization known as Daedalus Labs, led by the story\'92s big bad, Dr. Ethan Thorne. Something I often do is write in-universe "lab reports" and other assorted documents, with the intention of them having been written by Daedalus employees and stored in their database. For this assignment, I've chosen to make this very database, albeit with only a fraction of the documents that would exist in the in-universe one. (I'm only one guy; I can only write so much.)\
